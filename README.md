# Passing-in-Basketball
The Pass is what makes basketball flow, it's what makes offense work, it's what makes defenses crumble, it's what makes basketball beautiful.  

Since the 90s, the pass seemingly became un-cool.  Cool was crossovers and monster jams--unequivacably "ME" plays, or 1 on 1 plays that eschew the pass in favor of flair.

This projects theorizes that passing more leads to more winning.  We'll scrape historical data from NBA and NCAA Division I Mens Basketball games and compile statistics into a dataframe to be analyzed.  We will measure passing through "assists".  This is not a perfect measurement of total passing, but logically a high number of assists should indicate a higher rate of passing.
