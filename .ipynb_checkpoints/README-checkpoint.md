# Assists-and-Winning
The Pass is what makes basketball flow, it's what makes offense work, it's what makes defenses crumble, it's what makes basketball beautiful.  

Since the mid 80s, the pass seemingly became un-cool.  Cool was crossovers and monster jams--unequivacably "ME" plays, or 1 on 1 plays that eschew the pass in favor of flair.  It's impossible to know for sure what inspired the shift in style of play.  But looking at that line chart, and thinking about what icon of the sport came on the scene in the mid 80s...you have to think about His Airness.

This projects investigates passing and asks does passing more lead to winning more?  We'll scrape historical data from NBA and NCAA Division I Mens Basketball games and compile statistics into a dataframe to be analyzed.  We will measure passing through "assists".  This is not a perfect measurement of total passing, but logically a high number of assists should indicate a higher rate of passing.
